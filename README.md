Todo:
* Return viewed tweet count from scrape function
* Save it to user file
* Save the daily view tweet count to a file
* Reset it when the daily limit is done
* Add image scanning regardless of the data usage? Or just load everything (disable video autoplay)
* Fix something went wrong, please reload
* Handle videos, links, replies, retweets
* Check tweet limit

Note:
* Enable data saving in accessibility options to prevent images and videos from loading
* Unfortunately this must be done manually for each account, but that's no big issue
* Even better since it's a Twitter's inbuilt feature
